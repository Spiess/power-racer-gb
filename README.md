# Power Racer GB
Game Boy port of the open-source Java racing game Power Racer.

Currently still very much work-in-progress.

## Controls

- `Start` to start.
- `A` to accelerate.
- `Left / Right` to steer.

## Build Instructions

To assemble and link the ROM, you will need [RGBDS](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds) and run `make` in the project root.

Particularly the [Game Boy Assembly Tutorial](https://eldred.fr/gb-asm-tutorial/) and the [Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/) Game Boy technical reference have been invaluable resources.
Additional thanks to [FlappyBoy](http://voidptr.io/blog/2017/01/21/GameBoy.html) for providing a simple, open-source project example to learn from.
